# Rosalind Bioinformatics Challenges

This repository contains my solutions to the bioinformatics challenges provided by [Rosalind](http://rosalind.info/). Rosalind is a platform for learning bioinformatics through problem-solving.

## About Rosalind

Rosalind offers a collection of problems that are designed to teach bioinformatics algorithms and concepts. Each problem comes with a brief introduction to the biological background and a description of the computational task.

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized into folders, each corresponding to a different problem or set of problems. Each folder contains the following:

- `problem_description.md`: A markdown file with the problem description and biological background.
- `solution.py`: A Python script containing my solution to the problem.
- `data/`: A folder containing any input data files required for the problem.

## How to Use

### Clone the repository:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/rukhan4/Rosalind.git
cd Rosalind
```

### Run solution with bash script

```
bash run_solution.sh "Problem Folder Name"
```

### Run solution with python on command line

#### Navigate to folder of the problem you want to solve:

```sh
cd problem_name
```

#### Run the solution script:

```sh
python3 <input_file> <output_file>
```

## Dependencies

- Python 3.x
- sys (built in)

### Acknowledgments

Thanks to Rosalind for providing these excellent bioinformatics challenges.
Special thanks to the bioinformatics community for their support and resources.
