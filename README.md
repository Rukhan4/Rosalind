# Rosalind Bioinformatics Challenges

This repository contains my solutions to the bioinformatics challenges provided by [Rosalind](http://rosalind.info/). Rosalind is a platform for learning bioinformatics through problem-solving.

## About Rosalind

Rosalind offers a collection of problems that are designed to teach bioinformatics algorithms and concepts. Each problem comes with a brief introduction to the biological background and a description of the computational task.

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized into folders, each corresponding to a different problem or set of problems. Each folder contains the following:

- `problem_description.md`: A markdown file with the problem description and biological background.
- `solution.py`: A Python script containing my solution to the problem.
- `data/`: A folder containing any input data files required for the problem.

## How to Use

1. Clone the repository:

   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/rukhan4/Rosalind.git
   cd Rosalind
   ```

2. Navigate to the folder of the problem you want to solve:

   ```sh
   cd problem_name
   ```

3. Run the solution script:
   ```sh
   python solution.py
   ```

## Dependencies

- Python 3.x

### Acknowledgments
